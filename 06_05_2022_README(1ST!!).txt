ANYONE NOT IN THE KNOW RE: ANDROID/TERMUX/ROOTLESS_VS_ROOT/ (And therefore pretty much tech life - seriously, have you been living under a rock? Under the influence of some rock? Perhaps you were brainwashed into joining a cult and you were about to drink the Kool aid when the Feds busted in?) Well in any case, you need to know that this [version of Kali Linux nethunter (rootless) is 2 years old. If you're interested in installing nethunter rootless in termux, you can get the latest rolling release from the official site- offsec keeps the rootless mobile updated quarterly. The link is coming up once I say something about the termux/Android OS version 12+ selinux policy changes, mapping needs and generally the ball breakers that are goo.le.λнοιεζ
